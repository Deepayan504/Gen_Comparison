Comparison of GAN, VAE and Diffusion Model for global SST map generator.

With the looming threat of climate change, climate simulations are needed to design policies for mitigation and adaptation. Such simulations of weather and climate are usually done by Earth System Models, that involve many governing equations representing atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics, and chemistry, which need to be solved repeatedly to run simulations over a period of time. While these models-such as General Circulation Models (GCMs)-provide valuable insights, they are computationally intensive and require access to high-performance computing infrastructure. In recent years, deep neural models have emerged as a complementary approach to emulate climatic variables, thus offering a data-driven surrogate for process-based simulations at significantly lower computational cost. However, generation of long and accurate time-series of climatic variables is often difficult for such models, as this requires a) capturing the variability and interactions of atmospheric processes, and b) reproducing their evolution over time in a statistically and physically consistent way. Recent developments in Generative AI has sparked interest in using these models for climate emulation, especially for spatio-temporal data. This study investigates the performance of several widely used generative models-namely generative adversarial networks (GAN), variational autoencoders (VAE), and diffusion-based models-for emulation of global Sea Surface Temperature (SST). A comparative analysis has been conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in generating long-period (500 years) global SST maps, using networks with similar architectures. In each case, these models have been trained using global SST simulations by a GCM (GISS) from the CMIP6 family. The generated data is compared with GISS and observed data in terms of their statistical properties such as spatio-temporal patterns and inter-annual variability, following standard practices of Climate Science research. We find that the GAN emulations are most consistent with the observations, but can be matched by the other models in some cases.
